Computer Vision - BRIEF(Feature descriptor)


Description
===========
  
This code is a code that implements BRIFT, a method of Feature descriptor.

  Project Solution Design
---------
1. Consider all pixels as feature points (skip feature detection)
2. Generate 256 line patterns (random, around the center pixel, not overlapping) â€“ (applies the same 256 line pattern to all pixels)
3. For each pixel, 0/1 is determined by comparing which pixel is larger at both ends of the line, and a 256-bit descriptor is generated from 256 lines.
4. 256-bit descriptor is expressed as 8-bit image to check the result (for example, image is generated by only upper 8 bits)
